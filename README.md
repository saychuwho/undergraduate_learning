# UNDERGRATUATE LEARNING

This repository is place for my undergraduate codes. There are algorithm problem solutions(mainly [baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/)), undergraduate subject assignments.

## What's in here

### [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/) problem solutions

   - solutions mainly written with C++, some solutions written in python or C#

   - solutions are verified "success" in baekjoon scoring system

### Undergraduate Subject Assignment

#### Explain

- assignment code from DGIST computer science subject

- WARNING : DO NOT COPY THE EXACT CODE WHEN YOU ARE DGIST UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT. IT IS ILLEGAL TO COPY SOMEONES COMPLETE CODE. PLAGIARISM IS STRICTLY CAUGHT AND YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE.

- 경고 : 남의 코드를 그대로 베끼는 거는 표절입니다. 당신이 DGIST 학부생이라면, 표절은 절대로 해서는 안됩니다. 제 코드에서 아이디어를 얻는 거는 상관없으나, 여러분의 과제는 여러분 스스로 하셔야 합니다. 이 과제를 베껴서 제출했을 시 불이익은 여러분이 지셔야 합니다. 

- Subject I done assignment is
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - System Programming
  - Computer Architecture
  - Introduction to Machine Learning

#### What's In Assignment

- Object-Oriented Programming
  - team project code make ATM machine using C++

- System Programming
  - make file compression program running on Raspberry Pi
  - code is aimed to run on Raspberry Pi OS.
  - code might not work on normal Raspberry Pi OS. Because It need custom kernel made by professor.

- Computer Architecture
  - There are four assignment. All codes written in C++, aimed to run on Ubuntu 20.04.
  - project 1 : make simple MIPS Assembler
  - project 2 : make MIPS Instruction Emulator (might not work properly)
  - project 3 : make single pipeline CPU can run MIPS Instructions
  - project 4 : make cache and test with benchmark files. 

- Introduction to Machine Learning.
  - I cannot remember all assignment correctly of this subject now. But they might contain these things.
  - linear regression practice
  - supervised learning practice using scikit-learn
  - unsupervised learning practice using scikit-learn
  -
